Karl Broman (following [Nick Furlotte](http://whatmind.com))

In order to better understand [pylmm](https://github.com/nickFurlotte/pylmm),
for linear mixed models for genome-wide association studies
(GWAS), I'm porting it to R.  The goal is learning, and ultimately
LMMs for QTL mapping.

Take a look at the
[vignette](http://kbroman.org/lmmlite/assets/compare2pylmm.html)
comparing lmmlite and pylmm (and also the R package
[regress](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/regress/)).

There's
[another vignette on performance](http://kbroman.org/lmmlite/assets/performance.html)
relative to pylmm.
