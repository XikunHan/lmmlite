Karl Broman (following [Nick Furlotte](http://whatmind.com).)

I'm following the code in [pylmm](https://github.com/nickFurlotte/pylmm),
in order to understand it, and porting it to R.

The goal is linear mixed models for genome-wide association studies
(GWAS). Well, for me it's LMM for QTL mapping.
